# Dynamic Twitter 'Follow' Network

This is a dynamic visualization of the follow network of Twitter users during the first six months of it's existence (03/2006 to 08/2006).

The dynamism is illustrated by clicking on the 'Group Selector' dropleft menu and selecting different months. Each month links to a page which displays the state of the network during that month. Therefore, if the months are clicked ascendingly, the network can be visualized to be growing/emerging.

The InteractiveVis project of the Oxford Internet Institute with funding by JISC aims to allow easy creation of interactive visualisations for geospatial and network data using native web technologies (HTML5, CSS3, and SVG) and allow these visualisations to be self-contained so that they may run entirely offline in ebooks and other media. The project will survey existing solutions and build the necessary components to fill in missing features and smooth over incompatibilities in between existing libraries. The project will further provide online hosted wizards to allow for the easy creation of these interactive visualizations.
